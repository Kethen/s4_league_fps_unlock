## S4 League FPS unlock

- overrides shift fly, scythe uppercut, plasma sword jump attack speeds to something more consistent to 60fps behavior
- allows fps and fov adjustment

### Instructions
- load with an asi loader eg. https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader, ie. put `d3d9.dll`, `s4_league_fps_unlock.asi` and `s4_league_fps_unlock.json` next to the game exe
- fps limit and fov can be adjusted in `s4_league_fps_unlock.json`, setting fps limit to 0 lets the game go as fast as it can


json.hpp is optained from https://github.com/nlohmann v3.11.3 release
